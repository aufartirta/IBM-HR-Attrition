# Predicting Employee Turnover: HR Analytics and Strategic Interventions - IBM HR Analytics

## Project Overview
### Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze key factors contributing to employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics dataset. The goal is to identify the main drivers of turnover and provide data-driven strategic interventions to improve employee retention and reduce attrition.

### Data Sources:
The dataset used for this analysis is the [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset). This dataset provides insights into various employee attributes such as age, job role, job satisfaction, income, and attrition status.

### Key Metrics:
* Attrition Percentage: The rate at which employees leave the company.
* Average Income: The average salary for different job roles.
* Job Involvement: A measure of employee engagement with their role.
* Job Satisfaction: Employee-reported satisfaction levels.
* Age, Job Role, and Tenure: Demographics and professional experience of employees.

## Key Findings
1. Age: Younger employees, particularly those aged 18-25, experience the highest attrition rate at 35.77%, while older employees aged 40-60 have much lower attrition rates (11.18%). Younger employees also tend to have lower average incomes, contributing to their higher likelihood of leaving.

2. Job Role: Sales Representatives have the highest attrition rate at 39.76%, followed by Laboratory Technicians at 23.94%. In contrast, senior roles such as Research Directors (2.50%) and Managers (4.90%) show much lower attrition rates, likely due to higher income and job stability. This indicate job role and seniority play a significant role in employee retention.

3. Income: There is a clear relationship between income and attrition. Employees in higher-paying roles, such as Managers (average income: 17,181.68) and Research Directors (average income: 16,033.55), have lower attrition rates. Lower-paying roles like Sales Representatives (average income: 2,626.00) experience much higher attrition.

4. Job Involvement: Roles with higher job involvement, such as Research Directors (2.78) and Managers (2.77), have lower attrition. Conversely, employees with lower job involvement, such as Sales Representatives (2.65), tend to have higher turnover.

5. Tenure and Experience: Employees with less than 5 years of experience have an attrition rate of 28.80%, while those with more than 20 years of experience have an attrition rate of 7.73%, indicating that attrition decreases as tenure increases.

## Conclusions
1. The analysis shows that age, job role, income, and job involvement are the key factors driving employee attrition. Younger employees, particularly those in lower-paying, high-pressure roles like Sales Representatives and Laboratory Technicians, are more likely to leave. Employees in senior roles, with higher incomes and greater involvement, tend to stay longer. Additionally, employees with more experience and longer tenure show greater job stability.

2. To address high attrition, organizations must focus on improving engagement, job satisfaction, and compensation in high-turnover roles while also providing career development opportunities for younger employees.

## Recommendations
1. Improve Engagement and Satisfaction for High-Turnover Roles:
For roles with high attrition rates, such as Sales Representatives and Laboratory Technicians, focus on increasing job involvement through career development programs, recognition systems, and clearer paths to promotion. Improving job satisfaction in these roles could significantly reduce turnover.

2. Enhance Compensation for Entry-Level and High-Turnover Roles:
Review the compensation structure for lower-paying roles, especially for Sales Representatives, Laboratory Technicians, and Human Resources employees. Offering competitive salaries or performance-based incentives can reduce attrition in these high-turnover roles.

3. Focus on Career Development for Younger Employees:
Implement training and mentorship programs targeting employees aged 18-25 to provide them with clear career growth opportunities. This will reduce attrition by making younger employees feel more invested in the company.

4. Strengthen Work-Life Balance Initiatives:
Given the high attrition rates linked to poor work-life balance, implement flexible work arrangements, such as remote work or flexible hours, particularly in high-pressure roles like Sales.

5. Retain Senior and High-Performing Employees:
For employees in senior roles, such as Managers and Research Directors, maintain retention by offering leadership development programs, competitive compensation, and enhanced work-life balance options to ensure they remain engaged and satisfied.
